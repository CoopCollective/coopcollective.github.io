# Episode Summary

Welcome to the second episode of The Cock Talk Podcast. We deep dive and speculate on the different heritage types, stock, perfection score, and talents and how each may potentially play a role in the game as far as breeding generations and racing. 

We discus the amazing Chicken Derby video that was dropped that showed an early look at gameplay and talents in action. Talk about how you can enter in to the Cock of the Day and potentially get voted Cock of the Week! Check that out on Instagram at @chickenderby.
