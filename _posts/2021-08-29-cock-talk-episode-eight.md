# Episode Summary

What's up! Welcome to the Cock Talk Podcast.

We talk market movement, Apex nuggets, moving floors, and the myth, the legend CUPPY! 

We had the opportunity to ask Cuppy himself some questions about the game, and what he plans to do with all those chickens. The best part....he gave us some to give away!!! 
We gave away two chickens live on tonight's show and be on the watch for tomorrows twitter post to try and win the third!

Follow us on twitter @cocktalkderby and be on the watch for the details! 

Hope you enjoy!!
