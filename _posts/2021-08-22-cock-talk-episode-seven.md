# Episode Summary

What's up! Welcome to the Cock Talk Podcast.

We show off the chicken that we gave away, a beautiful 95 Lakenvelder!! 

We talk about the floors, 48 hours removed from the final Spicy Chicken drop. Pull up an excellent chart that breaks down all the floors of respective perfections, talents and heritages. Big thanks to cjbutterman for providing that in the Discord. After that, we deep dive in to the heritage of the Dorking. Talk about obvious clues from the Chicken Derby Tutorial, and break down a comment the developer made in the Discord Chicken Coop.

Hope you enjoy!! 

PS beware of scammers! If you need help ask a Discord mod
