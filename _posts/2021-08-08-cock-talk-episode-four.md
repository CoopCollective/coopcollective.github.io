# Episode Summary

What's up! Welcome to the Cock Talk Podcast.

We break out the tinfoil hats again, we dive into the talents again, some more possible breeding theories and how traits/talents may cross over. We discuss the chicken market, how transparent this project has been, and just how great the chicken discord community really is! 

Don't forget to subscribe to the youtube channel/streaming provider and also give us a follow on twitter @cocktalkderby
