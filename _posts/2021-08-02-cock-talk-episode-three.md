# Episode Summary

Welcome to the third edition of Cock Talk! 

This week we dive a little further in to breeding. We discuss the possible outcomes of heritage and possibly perfection when breeding is available. Then we break down talents a little further, speculate on how often they are deployed and how they may weigh in to each race.
